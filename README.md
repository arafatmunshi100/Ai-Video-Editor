Auto Video Clipper
- Automatically clips a 30-second highlight from your video using AI.

Requirements:
- Windows (sorry, this .exe is Windows-only!)
- FFmpeg: Download from ffmpeg.org, extract, and add the 'bin' folder to your system PATH (Google "add FFmpeg to PATH Windows" if unsure).

How to Use:
1. Double-click auto_video_clipper.exe.
2. Click "Browse" to pick your video file (.mp4, .avi, .mov).
3. Click "Browse" to choose an output folder.
4. Click "Clip Video" and wait for the progress bar to finish.
5. Check your output folder for the clipped video.

Note: Needs internet for AI processing. If it fails, ensure FFmpeg is installed correctly.
